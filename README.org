Hey there, I’m the person behind this minimal dark corner of the internet - armed with a keyboard, a caffeine drip, and a suspicious obsession with clean typography.

  - I build things with code, coffee, and occasional wizardry.
  - I break production only on Tuesdays (statistically speaking).
  - I keep code light, jokes dry, and tests… running eventually.
