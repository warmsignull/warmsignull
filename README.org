I build systems with code and an unreasonable attention to structure.

I aim for clean design, explicit tradeoffs, and tests that usually pass for the right reasons.
Jokes are dry, abstractions are questioned, and “it works” is never the end of the discussion.

Open to collaboration, thoughtful criticism, and the occasional argument about tabs vs. spaces.
(it's tabs)
