Hey there, I’m the person behind this minimal dark corner of the internet - armed with a keyboard, a caffeine drip, and a suspicious obsession with clean typography.

  - I build things with code, coffee, and occasional wizardry.
  - I break production only on Tuesdays (statistically speaking).
  - I keep code light, jokes dry, and tests… running eventually.

  Reach out if you want to collaborate, swap theme tweaks, or argue about tabs vs. spaces. (just kidding, it’s tabs)
